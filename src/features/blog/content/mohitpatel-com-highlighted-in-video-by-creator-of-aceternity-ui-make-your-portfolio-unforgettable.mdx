I’m **Mohit Patel**, an Electrical Engineering undergraduate with a strong interest in **computer vision, edge AI, and conservation technology**.

This page presents an **author-level overview** of my research paper  
**“Real-Time Wildlife Monitoring on Edge Devices Using Computer Vision and Geospatial Analysis.”**

Instead of repeating the paper verbatim, this post explains **what I built, why it matters, and how it reflects my technical and research profile** — similar to how a research project is presented on an academic CV or portfolio.

## Research focus and motivation

This research addresses a core problem in wildlife conservation:

> **How can animal movement, behavior, and resource usage be monitored at scale without invasive methods or expensive infrastructure?**

Traditional monitoring approaches such as manual surveys, tagging, and static camera traps are:

- Labor-intensive  
- Limited in coverage  
- Often intrusive  
- Poorly integrated with spatial analytics  

The objective of this work was to design a **low-cost, real-time, automated wildlife monitoring system** deployable in forest environments using **edge AI and open-source tools**.

---

## What I built (system overview)

I designed and implemented a **unified monitoring framework** that integrates:

- Real-time animal detection  
- Species classification  
- Multi-object tracking  
- GPS-based geospatial logging  
- Interactive spatial visualization  

The entire system is optimized for **edge deployment**, enabling long-term, scalable monitoring.

## Key technical contributions

### Real-time detection using YOLOv8
- Implemented YOLOv8 for live wildlife detection  
- Fine-tuned pretrained models on wildlife datasets  
- Optimized inference for Raspberry Pi-class hardware  

### Species classification
- Built a lightweight CNN for species recognition  
- Operates on cropped detections  
- Achieved **>90% accuracy** for common species  

### Multi-object tracking (Deep SORT)
- Enabled persistent identity tracking  
- Extracted trajectories and movement patterns  
- Identified recurring activity and congregation zones  

### Edge-based deployment
- Raspberry Pi 4 for continuous video inference  
- ESP32-CAM for low-power image-based monitoring  
- No reliance on cloud connectivity  

### Geospatial mapping and analysis
- GPS-tagged detections mapped in WGS84 format  
- Integrated Folium and QGIS for spatial visualization  
- Correlated wildlife activity with proximity to water sources

## Research outcomes

- Robust detection in dense forest and variable lighting  
- Stable tracking with minimal ID switching  
- Clear spatial clustering around water sources  
- Actionable insights for habitat and resource planning

## Practical and conservation impact

This work enables:

- Data-driven placement of artificial water sources  
- Identification of high-risk and high-activity zones  
- Support for anti-poaching strategies  
- Long-term ecological monitoring  

The system shifts conservation efforts from **manual observation to intelligent, real-time analytics**.

## Future scope

Planned extensions include:

- Thermal and infrared imaging  
- LoRa / mesh networking for remote nodes  
- Anomaly detection for intrusion events  
- Multi-site longitudinal ecological studies

## Why this research matters for my profile

This project demonstrates my ability to:

- Design end-to-end AI systems  
- Work across AI, hardware, and geospatial domains  
- Apply research to real-world environmental problems  
- Build deployable, production-ready systems
